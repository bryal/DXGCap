# NO MAINTENANCE INTENDED

Deprecated in favor of my new(er) Rust-version of this kind of software, [https://github.com/bryal/dxgcap-rs](dxgcap-rs).

# DXGCap

A small library for capturing the screen with DXGI in C++.
Might be optimized for use through FFI in Rust, since thats where I intend to use it.
